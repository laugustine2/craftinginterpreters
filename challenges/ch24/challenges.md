Chapter 24 Challenges
=====================

# 1. Store the `ip` field directly in a local variable and mark it `register` to encourage the compiler to keep it in a native CPU register. Write a coule of benchmarks to measure how it affects performance. Is the extra code complexity worth it?

* [Implementation](./ip-register-variable/)

# 2. Add arity checking to native function calls.

# 3. Extend the native function system to support reporting runtime errors. How does this capability affect the performance of native calls?

# 4. Add some more native functions to do things you find useful and write some programs using those. How do the affect the feel of the language and how practical it is?
