# 1. Fire up a profiler, run a couple of benchmarks, and look for other hotspots. Do you see anything in the runtime that you can improve?

# 2. A classic optimization is to create separate value representation for small strings that store the characters inline. Implement this and measure with a couple benchmarks.

# 3. What parts of the book worked well? What didnâ€™t? Was it easier to learn bottom-up or top-down? Did the illustrations help or distract? Did the analogies clarify or confuse?
