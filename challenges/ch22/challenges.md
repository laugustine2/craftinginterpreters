Chapter 22 Challenges
=====================

# 1. Come up with a more efficient approach to resolving a reference to a variable than a linear array scan. Is the additional complexity worth it?

# 2. How do other languages handle the following code? What would you do if it was your language? Why?

```java
var a = a;
```

# 3. Pick a keyword for a single-assignment variable form and add to Lox. Justify your choice, then implement it. An atttmpt to assign to a variable declared using the new keyword should cause a compile error.

# 4. Extend clox to allow more than 256 local variable to be in scope at a time.
