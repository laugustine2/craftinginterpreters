Chapter 29 Challenges
=====================

# 1. Inheritance complicates invariants defined by an initializer. A subclass' `init()` method must call `super.init()` and two classes in an inheritance chain may claim the same field name. How would you address this? If you would change the language, implement that change.

# 2. How do other language implementations support class modification while keep method resolution efficient?

# 3. Implement the `BETA` language's approach to method overriding. (See [Ch 13 challenge 2](../ch13/challenges.md))
