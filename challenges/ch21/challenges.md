Chapter 21 Challenges
=====================

# 1. Add an optimization that avoids adding a global variableâ€™s name to the constant table every time an identifier is encountered. How does this affect the performance of the compiler compared to the runtime? Is this the right trade-off?

* [Implementation](./dedup-constant-table)
* The upside is the programs can reference more constants by collapsing duplicates. The downside is it dds a check for every constant that iterates through the list of previously defined constants. The added cost is more impactful for an interpreted language that needs to be parsed before execution and there is not compensating performance benefit during runtime.

# 2. Can you come up with a more efficient way to store and access global variables without changing the semantics?

# 3. Should mistakes like unused functions and accessing variables that are never defined be reported as compile errors when running from a script? What do other scripting languages you know do?
