Chapter 21 Challenges
=====================

# 1. Add an optimization that avoids adding a global variableâ€™s name to the constant table every time an identifier is encountered. How does this affect the performance of the compiler compared to the runtime? Is this the right trade-off?

* [Implementation](./dedup-constant-table)

# 2. Can you come up with a more efficient way to store and access global variables without changing the semantics?

# 3. Should mistakes like unused functions and accessing variables that are never defined be reported as compile errors when running from a script? What do other scripting languages you know do?
