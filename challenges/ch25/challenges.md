Chapter 25 Challenges
=====================

# 1. Change `clox` to only wrap functions in ObjClosures that ned upvalues. How does the code complexity and performance compare to always wrapping functions?

* [Implementation](./upvalue-only-closure/)

# 2. Change the implementation to create a new variable for each loop iteration.

# 3. Using closures, write a `Lox` program that model two-dimensional vector "objects". It should (1) define a "constructor" to create a new vector with the given x and y coordinates, (2) provide "methods" to access the x and y coordinates of values returned from that constructor, (3) define and addition "method" that adds two vectors and produces a third.
